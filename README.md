# AsymmetricEncryption
Object Oriented Code for Asymmetric Encryption

-- How does it work --

The class "AsymmetricEncryption" will have only two functions:

- asymmetric_encrypt(): which will be used for encrypting a message in a bytes format.
- asymmetric_decrypt(): which will be used for decrypting a message in a bytes format.

This code uses the Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm to generate the private and public key. Also, it uses the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) scheme to generate the padding used by SHA256 and the Mask Generation Function (MGF1) to generate a securing mask for the blocks generated by SHA256.

Feel free to make any needed changes.
